# Lab objectives

After this lab you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze survival data using Cox proportional hazard model in RStudio.
\item Estimate survival function for individuals with given covariate values.
\end{itemize}

%# Build Cox proportional hazard model

# Read data manually into R.

We will use the same data set from last lab. Run the following code to read data into RStudio

```{r}
bmt <- data.frame(allo = c(rep(1, 16), rep(2, 27)),
                  hodgkins = c(rep(1,11), rep(2,5), rep(1,12), rep(2,15)),
                  time = c(28,32,49,84,357,933,1078,1183,1560,2114,2144,
                           2,4,72,77,79,42,53,57,63,81,140,81,252,524,210,
                           476,1037,30,36,41,52,62,108,132,180,307,406,
                           446,484,748,1290,1345),
                  status = c(1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
                             1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0),
                  kscore = c(90,30,40,60,70,90,100,90,80,80,90,20,50,80,
                             60,70,80,90,30,60,50,100,50,90,90,90,90,90,
                             90,80,70,60,90,70,60,100,100,100,100,90,
                             90,90,80),
                  wtime = c(24,7,8,10,42,9,16,16,20,27,5,34,28,59,102,71,
                            19,17,9,13,12,11,12,21,39,16,24,84,73,61,34,
                            18,40,65,17,61,24,48,52,84,171,20,98))
```


The data set contains 6 variables

* __allo__: Graft type (1=allogenic, 2=autologous);
* __hodgkins__: Disease type (1=Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 2=Hodgkins disease);
* __time__: Time to death or relapse, days;
* __status__: Death/relapse indicator (0=alive, 1=dead);
* __kscore__: Karnofsky score;
* __wtime__: Waiting time to transplant in months.

# Cox proportional hazard model

The Cox proportional hazard model is implemented with  coxph() in R. 
```{r}
library(survival)
###To be consistent with SAS output, we use allo=2 as the reference level for
#allo, and hodgkins=2 as the reference level for hodgkins 
bmt$allo<-factor(bmt$allo,level=c(2,1))
bmt$hodgkins<-factor(bmt$hodgkins,level=c(2,1))
censored <- Surv(bmt$time, bmt$status)
fit1 <- coxph(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ allo + hodgkins +kscore + wtime, data = bmt)
summary(fit1)

```
* __coxph__ is used to fit Cox proportional hazard model to survival times.
* __formula__ statement specifies the following regression model
\begin{center}
$h(t)=h_0(t)exp(\beta_1allo+\beta_2hodgkins+\beta_3kscore+\beta_4wtime),$
\end{center}
where $h(t)$ is the hazard at time $t$ given a set of covariates, $h_0(t)$ represents the baseline hazard function when all covariates are at their baseline values (most of time the baseline value is 0).
* Function __summary__ gives a complete summary of the  estimation results.

In the R output,

  +  coef ---- the estimated regression coefficients
  + exp(coef) ---- the estimated hazard ratios. For each covariate, its hazard ratio compares the hazard rates when there is 1-unit increase for this covariate with all other covariates fixed. For example, the hazard ratio for the categorical covariate "allo" is
\begin{center}
$\frac{h(t)_{allo=1}}{h(t)_{allo=2}}=exp(\hat{\beta}_1)=exp(0.23)=1.26.$
\end{center}
That is, it is estimated that the risk of death is 1.26 times higher for patients with allogenic transplant, as compared to patients with autologous. Notice that 'allo' value 2 is treated as reference level. 
For a continous covariate, Karnofsky score, note that
$\frac{h(t)_{kscore=k+1}}{h(t)_{kscore=k}}=exp(\hat{\beta}_3)=exp(-0.056)=0.94.$
That is, it is estimated that the risk of experiencing death decreases by 1-0.946=5.4% with 1-unit increase in the Karnofsky score.
   + se(coef)-- the standard error of the estimated coefficient.
   + z --- the z-value calculated as $\frac{coef}{se(coef)}$.
   + Pr(>|z|) ---  the p-value for testing if coef=0.
   +In the second table, it also output the 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratios. lower .95 gives the lower bound, and upper .95 gives the upper bound for the 95% confidence interval.


For continuous covariate we can estimate the  hazard ratio with customized size of increment. Specify the increment using "scale=" argument in the __summary()__ function. The default increment is 1-unit. In the following, we use 10-unit increment in kscore, while 1-unit increasement for all the other covariates.

```{r}
summary(fit1, scale = c(1,1,10,1))$conf
```

 The "scale=" option helps us compute the hazard ratio when there is 10-unit increase in the Karnofsky score. It is estimated that the risk of experiencing death decreases 1-0.572=42.8% with every 10-unit increase in the Karnofsky score.


# Estimate survival function with a specific set of covariate values

After we estimate the Cox proportional hazard model, we can predict the survival profile for a new patient with a specific set of covariae values. For example, if we have two new patients, one with allogenic transplant (allo=1), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (hodgkins=1), Karnofsky score of 100 and 40 months of waiting time, and the other one with covariates autologous (allo=2), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (hodgkins=1), Karnofsky score of 80 and 10 months of waiting time. How can we estimate the survival functions for these two patients? First we need to create a new data frame that contains covariate values for these two patients.

```{r}
group <- data.frame(allo = c(1,2),hodgkins = c(1,1),
                    kscore = c(100,80),wtime = c(40,10),id=c(1,2))

```

The $id$  in this new data set "group" gives the id number for each group. This new data frame is passed to **survfit()** via the **newdata** argument. Now we can visualize survival functions of these two potential patient groups. Finally we use **ggsurvplot** to draw the survival functions.

```{r}
library(survminer)
fit2 <- survfit(fit1, newdata = group)
ggsurvplot(fit2, data = group, conf.int = FALSE)
```
The color in the plot indicates different groups. Based on the survival functions, the group 1 (in red) has better survival chance than the group 2 (in blue).

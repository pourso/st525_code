# Lab objectives

After today's lab you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Build parametric regression model for survival data and output residuals for model diagnosis.
\item Calculate test statistics for making statistical inference on regression coefficients.
\item Use residuals to assess the fit of a model.
\end{itemize}

# Read data manually into R

We will use the same data from the previous lab. This data set contains 43 bone marrow transplant patients. These patients had either Hodgkin's disease or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and were given either an allogeneic (Allo) transplant (from a HLA match sibling donor) or autogeneic (Auto) transplant (their own marrow was cleansed and returned to them after a high dose of chemotherapy). Other covariates are Karnofsky score (a subjective measure of how well the patient is doing, ranging from 0-100) and waiting time (in months) from diagnosis to transplant. It is of substantial interest to see the difference in leukemia-free survival (in days) between those patients given an Allo or Auto transplant, after adjusting for patients' disease status, Karnofsky score and waiting time. We will fit an Exponential model to the data.

bmt <- data.frame(allo = c(rep(1, 16), rep(2, 27)),
                  hodgkins = c(rep(1,11), rep(2,5), rep(1,12), rep(2,15)),
                  time = c(28,32,49,84,357,933,1078,1183,1560,2114,2144,

 The data set contains 6 variables
 
* __allo__: Graft type (1=allogenic, 2=autologous);
* __hodgkins__: Disease type (1=Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 2=Hodgkins disease);
* __time__: Time to death or relapse, days;
* __status__: Death/relapse indicator (0=alive, 1=dead);
* __kscore__: Karnofsky score;
* __wtime__: Waiting time to transplant in months.

# Exponential regression model for survival time
1. Run the following code
```{r}
library(survival)
censored <- Surv(bmt$time, bmt$status)
fit1 <- survreg(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ 
                  allo + hodgkins + kscore + wtime,
                data = bmt, dist = 'exponential')
summary(fit1)

```
* __survreg__ is used to fit parametric regression model to survival times.
* __formula__ statement specifies the following regression model
\begin{center}
$log(T)=\beta_0+\beta_1allo+\beta_2hodgkins+\beta_3kscore+\beta_4wtime+\sigma\epsilon,$
\end{center}
in which $T$ represents the survival time. 
* __dist__ is used to define the distribution for response variable. In particular, dist = 'exponential' gives exponential regression. Other options include "weibull", "gaussian", "logistic","lognormal" and "loglogistic".

__Wald test__: The above table gives the parameter estimation and testing results for each of the regression coefficients. For example, for covariate allo, the estimated regression coefficient is -0.1333. Consider testing of hypothesis that $H_0:\beta_{allo}=0 \ vs \ H_1:\beta_{allo}\ne0$. The Wald test statisitcs is calculated as
$Z_{wald}=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{allo}}{SE}=\frac{-0.1333}{0.4607}=-0.29$. Then the p-value for this two sided hypothesis is $P(|Z|>0.29)=0.7723.$
Equivalently, one can also square the Z-test statistics to obtain a Chi-squared Wald test statistics, 
\begin{center}
$\chi_{Wald}^2 =Z_{Wald}^2=(\frac{\hat{\beta}_{allo}}{SE})^2=(\frac{-0.1333}{0.4607})^2=(-0.29)^2=0.08$
\end{center}
Its corresponding p-value compared with chi-square distribution with df = 1 is $P(\chi_1^2>0.08)=0.7723.$

__Likelihood ratio (LR) test__: Alternatively, we can use likelihood ratio test to test the significance of covariate allo. To obtain LR test, we need to fit two regression models: one with allo, and the other one without allo. We then calculate the difference of the maximized likelihood from these two models.

```{r}
fit2 <- survreg(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ 
                  hodgkins + kscore + wtime,
                data = bmt, dist = 'exponential')
summary(fit2)
2 * (fit1$loglik[2] - fit2$loglik[2])
```

So the LR test statistics is calculated as
\begin{center}
$\chi_{LR}^2=2(-168.3158+168.3579)=0.0842,$
\end{center}
and the corresponding p-value is $P(\chi_1^2>0.0842)=0.7716844$. The testing results from Wald and LR tests are consistent. Both give large p-values and we fail to reject the null hypothesis that $H_0:\beta_{allo}=0.$

# Use residuals to assess the fit of a model

Up to now, we have fitted the survival data with an Exponential model. In other words, given a set of covariates we believe that the survival time follows an Exponential distribution. This is an assumption without justification. The correctness of further inference heavily depends on the correctness of this Exponential distribution assumption. Cox-Snell residuals are used to assess the distribution assumptions. Here we need to calculate these two types of residuals on our own.

## Calculation of standardized residuals and Cox-Snell residuals

Recall that 

* Standardized residual $sderr_i$ for the $i$-th observation is 
\begin{center}
$sderr_i=\frac{log(T_i)-\widehat{log(T_i)}}{\hat{\sigma}}=\frac{log(T_i)-(\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1allo_i+\hat{\beta}_2hodgkins_i+\hat{\beta}_3kscore_i+\hat{\beta}_4wtime_i)}{\hat{\sigma}}$
\end{center}

* The Cox-Snell residual $csr_i$ for the $i-$th observation is defined
\begin{center}
$csr_i=\hat{H}(T_i|{\bf X}_i),$
\end{center}
where $\hat{H}$ is the estimated cumulative hazard function, whose form depends on parametric regression model. Under Exponetial distribution, the cumulative hazard function $H(t|{\bf X}_i)=t\exp\{-(\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1allo_i+\hat{\beta}_2hodgkins_i+\hat{\beta}_3kscore_i+\hat{\beta}_4wtime_i))\}$.

In the following,  __fit1$linear.predictors__ stores the predicted values of our regression model, which is $\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1 x_1+\dots+\hat{\beta}_px_p$. Then above formulas are used to calculate the Standardized residuals and Cox-Snell residual respectively.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
sderr <- (log(bmt$time) - fit1$linear.predictors)/fit1$scale
qplot(bmt$time, sderr, main = c('Standardized residuals from Exponential regression')) +
  xlab('time') + ylab('Standardized Residual') 

csr <- bmt$time * exp(-fit1$linear.predictors) 
qplot(bmt$time, csr, main = c('Cox-Snell residuals from Exponential regression')) +
  xlab('time') + ylab('Cox-Snell Residual') 

```

In above two plots, we observe that 

* Standardized residuals (sderr) can take negative values, but not symmetric.
* Cox-snell residuals (csr) always positive, if Exponential regression is a correct fit, then the residuals should follow Exp(1) distribution.

## Use Cox-Snell residuals to access model fit

The key is that if the model is correctly specified, then the Cox-Snell residuals can be viewed as a right-censored sample from $Exp(1)$. Recall if $\underline{X}$ are samples from an Exponential distribution, then $-log(\hat{S}(\underline{X}))$ should be linear in $\underline{X}$. Here the Cox-Snell residual follows $Exp(1)$, then if we plot $-log(\hat{S})$ vs. Cox-Snell residuals, we should obtain a straight line approximately.

Therefore, to check if Exponential regression model is appropriate, We first use K-M method to estimate the survival function using the Cox-Snell residuals, then plot $-log(survival \ function) vs. time$, but here the time is Cox-Snell residuals.
```{r}
# Calculate KM estimators
fit3 <- survfit(Surv(csr, status) ~ 1, data = bmt)
# Time vs -log(survival function) plot
plot(fit3$time,-log(fit3$surv))
```
What we are looking for is the linear relationship on the plot, especially at the beginning of the plot. In this plot, it looks fine to use Exponential distribution to model the survival time in this data set, even though there might be some departure from the linearity at the end part.

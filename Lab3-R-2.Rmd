# Lab objectives

After today's lab you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Read survival data into SAS with different format for time variable.
\item Put survival data into correct structure for survival analysis.
\item Create enhanced graphs with ggplot2.
\end{itemize}

# Read data into R

1. Download hmohiv.csv from Canvas and save on your desktop folder (or any folder in your computer).
2. Open the RStudio. Make sure the file is saved under your R working directory. You can use the function __setwd()__ to change the working directory to where you saved the data file.
3. Run the following code to read data into RStudio.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
hmo<- read.csv('hmohiv.csv', header = TRUE, 
               colClasses = c(NA, 'character', 'character',NA, NA, 'factor'))
head(hmo, 3) # Check the first 3 rows.
```
The argument "colClasses" in the __read.csv()__ defines the type of each column variable:

* "character" for two date variables (StartDate, EndDate) 
* "factor" for the Censoring indicator (Censor)
* "NA" for using the default type (numerical in this example).

```{r}
hmo$StartDate <- hmo$StartDate %>% 
  strsplit(split = ' ') %>% 
  sapply(function(x) x[1]) %>% 
  as.Date(format = c("%m/%d/%y")) 

hmo$EndDate <- hmo$EndDate %>% 
  strsplit(split = ' ') %>% 
  sapply(function(x) x[1]) %>% 
  as.Date(format = c("%m/%d/%y")) 

head(hmo, 3) # Check the first 3 rows.
```

* The function __strsplit()__ is used to split a string into substrings. Use argument "split" to indicate the character used for splitting. Here a space ' 'is used for splitting.  The returned value of this function is a list.
* The function __sapply(X, FUN)__ returns a vector of the same length as X, with each element being the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X. Here we use a function __function(x) x[1]__ to extract the first item of each list element.
* __as.Date()__ converts a string to a date type in R. The argument format is used to indicate the format of the string. Here "%m/%d/%y" means the strings (StartDate or EndDate) are in format "m/d/y".



In this data set, it contains the following variables:

* __Id__: subject's ID number
* __Startdate__: date of entry into study
* __Enddate__: date of death or censoring
* __Age__: age at entry into study in years
* __Drug__: IV drug user (1 = yes, 0 = no)
* __Censor__: 1 = died, 0 = censored

4. Calculate the survival time of interest
```{r}
hmo$Time_day <- difftime(hmo$EndDate, hmo$StartDate, units = 'days') %>% as.numeric()
hmo$Time_month <- round(12 * hmo$Time_day / 365.25)
head(hmo, 3) # Check the first 3 rows
```
* The function __difftime()__ can calculate the difference time between two date type values. The argument "units" claims the units in which the results are desired. This function returns a special class of data called "difftime", so we need to use __as.numeric()__ to convert it into numeric values.

# Plot Survival time against age using ggplot2.
1. We explore different features in package ggplot2. We will start with the simplest version.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = hmo) + geom_point(aes(x = Age, y = Time_month)) +
  labs(title = 'Time (in months) vs. Age: plot1') +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(15,55), expand = c(0, 0))

```
* The function __scale_x_continuous()__ is used to define the limits of x-axis and use __expand = c(0, 0)__ to indicate we hope no more extra space between the plot margin and the limits of x.

2. Now we can add more features: change the plotting symbol color, shape, and size; and change labels of the x-axis and y-axis.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hmo) + geom_point(aes(x = Age, y = Time_month), 
                              shape = 1, col = 'red', size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(15, 55), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = 'Time (in months) vs. Age: plot2') +
  xlab('Age (Years)') + ylab('Time (Months)')
```

3. We can plot survival time against age for different censoring types. So that we can differentiate between individuals who died from those were censored.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hmo) + geom_point(aes(x = Age, y = Time_month, 
                                  color = Censor)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(15, 55), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = 'Time (in months) vs. Age: plot3') +
  xlab('Age (Years)') + ylab('Survival Time (Months)') +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c('censored', 'died'))
```

# Supplement: More DATE types in R.

* For a variable in date type, you can print it in different formats using R function format()

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
Symbol = c("%d","%a","%A","%m","%b","%B","%y","%Y")
Meaning = c("day as a number (0-31)","abbreviated weekday","unabbreviated weekday","month (00-12)","abbreviated month","unabbreviated month","2-digit year","4-digit year")
Example = c("01-31","Mon","Monday","00-12","Jan","January","07","2007")
text<-cbind(Symbol,Meaning, Example) 
                
  kable(text,"latex", booktabs = T)
```


Some examples

```{r}
Sdate<-hmo$StartDate[1:3]
format(Sdate, format="%B %d %y")
format(Sdate, format="%m-%d-%Y")
```
